This project is a BBCode* compiler for use with bulletin boards or anywhere else
where BBCode is needed. The instructions for parsing BBCode tags can be customized
easily without touching the actual PHP code of the compiler. It's quite flexible,
actually.

The BBCode compiler library is found at src/BBCode/Parser.php. Default set of compiler
instructions are found at src/dtd.php.
